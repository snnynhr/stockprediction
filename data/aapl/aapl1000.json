Apple says few actual complaints have come in about bending of its supersize iPhone 6 Plus. But the company did have to pull back an update to its iOS 8 operating system.History suggests these won't hurt overall sales.

It also is one of Monitise's biggest customers, accounting for up to 15% of revenues, according to analyst calculations. Questions are now being asked about Visa Europe, the separate international-payments business, which holds 6% of Monitise and accounts for a similar chunk of sales. Monitise wouldn't confirm individual customer contributions, but said its contract with Visa runs until June 2016.Investors had assumed Monitise would be bought and had valued it in June at nine times forecast 2015 sales.

GT Advanced is building a sapphire-manufacturing facility in Arizona in partnership with Apple, which already uses the highly durable material in parts of its iPhone 5S. Many investors had speculated sapphire would replace Gorilla Glass as the cover material for Apple's newest smartphones. Yet the company told investors in early August that its facility wouldn't be fully online until next year—too late to be shipping in volume for the iPhone 6.Tuesday made clear that not only will the new iPhones not include sapphire, but only two of three Apple Watch designs will use it.
